# SendMoneyApp assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to evaluate your proficiency in iOS development, including UI
design, data handling, application state management, and implementation of dynamic features.

**App Features:**
- The Sign in page has an email and password field which is hardcoded to testuser and password123.
- After the sign in , we have the home screen which displays the send money screen and saved requests screen in a tab bar.
- The user can switch to Arabic or English using the navigation bar button on the top.
- The send money screen is loaded dynamically based on the json provided.
- All the validations are added before we click the send button.
- Once the transaction is completed, we can see the saved requests on the Saved requests tab.

  
**Architecture Pattern**: 
MVVM is used for the UI and Redux is used for the state management.
